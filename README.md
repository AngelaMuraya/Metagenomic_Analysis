# EANBiT 2019 Residential Training Mini-Projects

Mini-projects for the residential training. As part of the EANBiT Residential training 2019, you will collaboratively work on mini-projects in groups of four. 

## Projects

1. [Microbiome of two predominant seagrass species of the Kenyan coast, Enhalus acoroides and Thalassodendron ciliatum](project_1_seagrass_microbiome.md)
2. [Microbiome metagenomics analysis of Kilifi creek mangrove sediments](project_2_mangrove_metagenomics.md)
3. [Reproduce genomic analysis](project_3_reproduce_genomic_analysis.md)
4. [Variant Calling Workflow Pipeline](project_4_variant_calling_workflow.md)
5. [A project on whole-genome assembly, annotation and phylogenetic analysis](project_5_fungal_whole_genome_and_phylogeny.md)

## Expected
- Work collaboratively on the project. In your report, you need to state the role played by each group member.
- Assign tasks to group members using GitHub issues **and** learn from each other. Every member of the group must be knowledgeable of the work of the whole group
- Comment your scripts in a nice and informative way. Your scripts, programs, workflows, etc, will be reviewed as a critical part of the project assessment
- Your writeup should be complete with visualizations
- Collaborate via Git & GitHub, making use of the Git Workflow
